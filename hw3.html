    <p> San Francisco 49ers have rich history of success, with five Superbowl championships. With victories in Superbowl XVI, XIX, XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX, the 49ers have earned themselves as one of the most successful teams in NFL history. The 49ers was established in 1946. Candlestick Park in San Francisco was the first stadium 49ers played at and won five superbowls during that time. In 2013, the San Francisco county have decided to demolished the stadium to create more housing in the bayview neighborhood. The San Francisco 49ers team was relocated to a new stadium in Santa Clara called Levi's Stadium, as their new home.</p>
